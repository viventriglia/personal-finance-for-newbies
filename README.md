## What is it?
**Personal Finance for Newbies** (or **PFN**) is a web app that ‚Äì from buy/sell financial asset transactions ‚Äì provides easy-to-use, near-real-time statistics (*i.e.*, updated to the last closing) on your investment portfolio.
<br><br>
PFN allows you to analyse your portfolio from **multiple perspectives**: from **higher-level metrics** (profit & loss, asset class weights) to those allowing you to study **risk** and **returns** in depth, especially over time. To use the app, you don't need to create an account! You just need to set up your buy/sell transactions: PFN takes care of downloading historical prices from [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) and analysing them for you!

## How can I run it?

### Streamlit
Install **dependencies** via [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) with

- `poetry install`

Launch the **web app** via

- `streamlit run ./src/0_üè†_Home.py`

### Docker
To build the app's Docker image

- `docker build -t personal-finance-for-newbies .`

To run the Docker image and expose it on a preferred port (for example 8080)

- `docker run --rm -p 8080:8501 personal-finance-for-newbies`

To run the Docker image using the host's network (which will make the app accessible on port 8501)

- `docker run --rm --network host personal-finance-for-newbies`

Alternatively, on Windows you simply launch

- `scripts/run-web-app.ps1`

### Docker-compose
To build and run the app's Docker image:

- `docker compose up streamlit`

You can choose, by editing the `.env` file in the project root, whether to install dependencies via `poetry` or via `uv` (a library written in RUST that greatly speeds up the installation of python libraries)

## How can I use my own data?
